# Medical Image Analysis Project

This repository contains code for analyzing medical images using deep learning models.

## Model Files

The trained model files are not included in this repository due to their large size:
- `src/model/efficientnet_pneumonia.pth`
- `src/model/resnet_best.pth` (90.08 MB)
- `src/model/swin_best-2.pth` (105.29 MB)

### How to Obtain the Model Files

To use this project, you'll need to download the model files separately. You can obtain them by:
1. Contacting the repository owner for access
2. [Optional] Download them from [insert your preferred file sharing service here]
3. [Optional] Run the model training scripts included in this repository

Once downloaded, place the model files in the `src/model/` directory.
